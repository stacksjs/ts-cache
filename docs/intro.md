# Introduction

ts-cache is a powerful TypeScript in-memory caching library designed to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory. This modern TypeScript port of the popular [node-cache](https://github.com/node-cache/node-cache) library provides a clean, type-safe API with enhanced features optimized for modern JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

## Features

### üöÄ High Performance

- Optimized for speed with minimal overhead
- Smart memory management with adjustable limits
- Configurable time-to-live (TTL) for cached items
- Automatic cleanup of expired items

### üõ°Ô∏è Type Safety

- Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- Generic methods for type-safe value retrieval
- IDE autocompletion for better developer experience
- Compile-time checking

### üîÑ Flexible API

- Simple get/set API for basic caching needs
- Fetch API for compute-if-absent pattern
- Multiple key operations (mget/mset/del)
- TTL management for fine-grained expiration control

### üìä Monitoring & Events

- Built-in statistics for cache performance monitoring
- Event emitter for cache operations (set, del, expired, etc.)
- Memory usage estimation
- Comprehensive error handling

### üîß Configurable

- Customizable TTL for each cached item
- Memory limits with max keys setting
- Clone behavior configuration
- Automatic cleanup interval adjustment

### Key Considerations

- The library uses ES modules for tree shaking
- TypeScript declarations enable great IDE integration
- Event-based architecture for reactive applications
- Minimal dependencies (only requires `ts-clone` package)

## Performance Optimization

ts-cache is optimized for:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Customizable size estimators for different data types
2. **Speed**: Minimal overhead for cache operations
3. **Configurability**: Adjust settings based on your specific use case
4. **Monitoring**: Track hits, misses, and other stats to optimize usage

## Use Cases

ts-cache is perfect for:

- API response caching
- Expensive computation results caching
- Database query result caching
- Session data storage
- Application configuration caching
- Rate limiting implementation
- Memoization of function results

## Real-World Example

Here's a quick example of using ts-cache to improve API response times:

```typescript
import { cache } from 'ts-cache'
import { fetchUserData } from './api'

// Function that uses cache for API responses
async function getUserData(userId: string) {
  // Check if data is already in cache
  const cachedData = cache.get<UserData>(userId)
  if (cachedData) {
    return cachedData
  }

  // If not in cache, fetch from API
  const userData = await fetchUserData(userId)

  // Store in cache for 5 minutes
  cache.set(userId, userData, 300)

  return userData
}

// Or using the built-in fetch method
async function getUserDataWithFetch(userId: string) {
  return cache.fetch(userId, 300, async () => {
    return await fetchUserData(userId)
  })
}
```

## Why ts-cache?

1. **Modern**: Built with TypeScript for modern applications
2. **Type-Safe**: Full type safety with generics for better developer experience
3. **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and small footprint
4. **Flexible**: Works in Node.js, Bun, and browser environments
5. **Performant**: Optimized for speed and memory efficiency
6. **Maintained**: Regular updates and improvements
